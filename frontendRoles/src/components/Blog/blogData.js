<br/><br/><p>For forty-five minutes, I lay on my yoga mat in child’s pose, unable to move.</p>

<p>The exhaustion in my body felt like a thousand kilos, and the ache of failure pricked my eyes with tears.</p>

<p>Despite all my early morning runs, after-work bootcamps, and restricted meals, my body did not look like the bikini models I saw on Instagram.</p>

<p>Despite all my energy, efforts, and attention, my romantic relationship had fallen apart. No matter what I did or how hard I tried, he didn’t love me anymore, and I couldn’t understand what I had done wrong.</p>

<p>Despite my long working hours and high levels of stress, my boss didn’t recognize me, and I had to face the fact that I just wasn’t the talented designer I was trying so hard to be.</p>
<br/>
<strong>As I wallowed in my failure and the heartbreak of ‘not enough,’ I felt my body pleading with me.</strong>

<p>“Why don’t you love me?” she asked. “Why do you push me so hard? Why is it NEVER enough?”</p>

<p>I was taken aback, as it was the first time I heard this voice, and it was full of the pain of rejection.</p>

<p>In that moment, I realized that everything I had been pushing for had been sending the message that I was ultimately unacceptable as I was. I needed to change or be different in order to be loved, valued, and successful.</p>

<p>The harder I tried to be perfect, to achieve, to prove my worth, the more exhausted, broken, and small I felt. By desperately trying to win other people’s approval, I was actually rejecting and abandoning myself.</p>

<p>This realization flooded me with grief. What had I done to myself???</p>

<p>Since this was clearly not working, I made a decision that changed my life.</p>

<p>“Okay,” I said to my body. “We’re going to do things differently.”</p>

<p>“From now on, I’m going to listen to you,” I promised. “We are going to do this TOGETHER.”</p>

<br/><strong>As soon as I made this commitment, I felt my body exhale with relief. She had been waiting for this moment my whole life.</strong>

<p>In the months that followed, I left my job, I left my friendships, and I left the home my ex and I had built together.</p>

<p>I found refuge on my parents’ couch with severe burnout. After years of pushing, my body had finally collapsed.</p>

<p>My body struggled to walk to the end of the street. Being in a store was so overly stimulating that I felt like I was going to pass out. I couldn’t sleep for months. I had severe stomach pains and terrible migraines, and I couldn’t think straight. My heart was broken. I felt like my life was over.</p>

<p>It was physically excruciating. It was emotionally devastating. It was the biggest blessing.</p>

<p>My body was giving me the chance to start again.</p>

<p>The thing about burnout is that you can never go back to how you were living before. That way was clearly not working: the lifestyle, the thought patterns, the identity, the environments—it was not serving you.</p>

<p>Burnout burns it all to the ground and forces you to start over.</p>

<p>My identity used to be a “hardworking, people-pleasing perfectionist addicted to external validation.” If I hadn’t done the inner work to let go of that pattern and completely rewire my identity, I would have ended up straight back in burnout just a few years later (which is, sadly, something that happens to others).</p>

<p>Trust me, burnout is not something you want to repeat. I promised myself I would NEVER end up in that situation again.</p>

<br/><strong>During my healing journey, I focused on building a relationship with myself and my body. Not one where I commanded and pushed my body, but one where I regularly checked in with her, learned to listen to her, and respectfully honored her needs.</strong>

<p>Every morning, I sat on my meditation cushion and took time to go within.</p>

<p>What was I feeling?</p>

<p>How was I speaking to myself?</p>

<p>Where was I judging myself?</p>

<p>What did my body need from me that day?</p>

<p>My burnout took two years, almost three, to recover from fully. To say I felt impatient to feel “normal” again is an understatement.</p>

<p>Any time I felt frustration toward my body, I quickly shifted my attitude to compassion and gratitude, recognizing that my body had been through hell and was doing her best to recharge back to optimal health. My impatience was only adding more stress that, honestly, she didn’t need to deal with.</p>

<p>It was in this way that I learned to love myself, as I was, without all the labels of achievement. Burnout had stripped away everything I had worked so hard for—my career, my relationships, my physique, my home. I had to learn to truly love myself without the badge of productivity.</p>

<br/><strong>Through this loving commitment, my body guided me on how to live a life that was right for me.</strong>

<p>I found I was a Human Design Projector, which is an intuitive guide who needs to manage their energy to stay happy and healthy in this hectic productive-obsessed world. I adjusted my schedule based on my energetic rhythms to include more rest and play in my day (which, admittedly, was not easy at first with my workaholic tendencies, but now I can’t imagine any other way).</p>

<p>Creating more space allowed me to find my soul’s purpose in teaching others how to connect to their bodies, love themselves unconditionally, and create successful lives in a sustainable way. I created a business based on what I love to do, began coaching women, and held retreats all over the world—without the extreme hustle I had been used to.</p>

<p>All the pressure to shrink down was gone. Instead of counting calories and pushing my body to the extreme, I focused on nutrition and movement that felt good. I didn’t care if my cellulite was showing or what people thought of the outfits I chose. The space that this opened up in my mind after years of obsession was the most freeing thing ever.</p>

<p>Learning to love my body changed my entire approach to life. It made me aware of my boundaries for the first time and helped me to create balanced relationships that felt truly fulfilling.</p>

<p>I went from overworking in a job I hated and over-giving in terrible relationships to running a purpose-led business where I get paid to be myself and surrounding myself with truly supportive people.</p>

<p>All because my body pulled the breaks on my old life and made me change direction. She showed me there was a more sustainable, more joyful, and more aligned way to make my dreams come true.</p>

<p>And for that, I am eternally grateful.</p>

        content: `
          <p>Anxiety is something many university students experience. With academic responsibilities, social pressures, and the looming uncertainty of the future, anxiety can start to feel overwhelming. But it’s essential to recognize when this normal feeling of worry becomes a disorder and learn how to manage it.</p><br/>
          <strong style="font-size: 20px">What is Anxiety?</strong>
          <p>Anxiety is not just feeling nervous before an exam or worried about a deadline. It’s a persistent feeling of worry or fear that can continue for weeks or months and begin to interfere with daily activities. The pressure of college life often amplifies these feelings, making it difficult to focus on studies, relationships, or even self-care.</p>
          <p>For many students, the experience of moving away from home, dealing with financial stress, and adjusting to new social environments contributes significantly to increased anxiety. But it’s important to remember that anxiety isn’t something to be ashamed of. It’s a common issue that can be managed with the right support.</p>
          <br/>
          <strong style="font-size: 20px">Common Symptoms of Anxiety</strong>
          <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px">
            <li>Constant Worry: Feeling worried about multiple things at once — whether it’s about exams, your future, relationships, or even daily tasks.</li>
            <li>Physical Symptoms: Anxiety often affects your body, causing headaches, chest pain, muscle tension, or an upset stomach. Many students also experience palpitations or a racing heart.</li>
            <li>Sleep Problems: Trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, waking up too early, or feeling unrested even after a full night’s sleep.</li>
            <li>Restlessness: Feeling like you can’t sit still or always being on edge.</li>
            <li>Difficulty Concentrating: Finding it hard to focus on assignments or lectures because your mind is preoccupied with anxious thoughts.</li>
          </ul>
          <br/>
          <strong style="font-size: 20px">Causes of Anxiety in University Students</strong>
          <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px">
            <li>Academic Pressure: The pressure to perform well, maintain scholarships, and succeed academically can create chronic stress.</li>
            <li>Financial Concerns: The burden of tuition fees, loans, and managing living expenses while studying can add to mental strain.</li>
            <li>Social Stress: Making new friends, dealing with peer pressure, and managing relationships can add to the mix.</li>
            <li>Future Uncertainty: Concerns about career prospects, internships, and what happens after graduation often cause anxiety.</li>
          </ul>
          <br/>
          <strong style="font-size: 20px">Coping Strategies for Managing Anxiety</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Practice Mindfulness: Mindfulness exercises, like meditation, deep breathing, or progressive muscle relaxation, can help you regain focus and calm your mind.</li>
            <li>Maintain a Healthy Routine: Sleep, diet, and exercise are vital in managing anxiety. Regular exercise releases endorphins, which help combat stress and anxiety.</li>
            <li>Stay Organized: Use a planner or digital apps to organize your tasks, deadlines, and study schedule. Breaking your work into manageable chunks reduces feelings of being overwhelmed.</li>
            <li>Seek Support: Talking to friends, family, or a counselor about how you’re feeling can provide relief. You don’t have to go through it alone.</li>
          </ul>
          <br/>
          <strong >Anxiety during college students is common but manageable. By recognizing the signs and taking strongroactive steps, you can navigate through it and enjoy your university experience. Remember that seeking help from professionals, like a counselor or therapist, is a sign of strength, not weakness.</p>

        content: `<strong>“Just being there for someone can sometimes bring hope when all seems hopeless.” ~Dave G. Llewellyn</strong><br/><br/>

<p>Have you ever found yourself in a situation where someone told you something deeply personal and traumatic, and you were stuck on what to say to them, how to act, and how to behave?</p>

<p>This happens to me regularly, and it’s not that I don’t have feelings or emotions about what’s happened to the person. I feel deeply sorry for them. But I sometimes freeze and don’t know what to say or do.</p>

<p>When it comes to mental health issues, this can be even harder to broach. And I say that with a severe amount of irony because I have mental health issues myself. I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder in 2017.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when we have experience with things, knowing what to say or do can still be difficult.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I want to share a few things I’ve learned from how people have treated me and how I’ve chosen to treat people.</p>

<p>Hopefully, after reading this, you won’t find yourself acting awkward when someone opens up to you about what they’re going through!</p>

<p>This generally applies to people you view as friends—people who would open up to you and be willing to share what’s happening inside their heads.</p>

<p>So, I guess a theme or mantra we can keep in mind would be, “A true friend shows care and concern whenever possible and, in fact, is a brother or sister who is born for times of distress.”</p>
<br/>
<strong style="font-size: 20px">What does this mean?</strong>
<p>Well, we ourselves can be overwhelmed when a friend is suffering from mental distress. We don’t know what to say. We don’t know what to do. Of course, we feel bad for them. Perhaps we even empathize with them.</p>

<p>But what’s more important is the fact that we show how much we care by trying to help them cope with what they’re going through.</p>
<br/>
<strong style="font-size: 20px">How do we do that? My first tip is to listen when they want to talk.</strong> You don’t have to respond to everything they say, but you should acknowledge what they say to show you’re fully listening. It could be just a gentle “aha” or an eyebrow raise.</p>

<p>Remember to remain compassionate as well. Don’t jump to conclusions; keep an open mind and avoid judgment.</p>

<p>When someone opens up to you, maybe they’re doing it for the first time and not thinking about how it sounds. They’ll probably say things that they don’t mean and might later regret. Just be a good friend and listen.</p>

<p>And if you disagree with something they say, sometimes it’s best to say nothing.</p>

<strong>The next pointer I have for you is that when you decide to speak (when you think it’s necessary to respond), remember to speak in a way that consoles them. Bear in mind that your friend, family member, or whoever it is, they’re probably anxious, and if they’re dealing with mental health issues, they likely feel some worthlessness as well.</strong>

<p>So, with your kind words, you can reassure them that you care, comfort them, and encourage them, even if you don’t know the ‘right’ things to say.</p>

<p>Your words might sound a bit muddled, but that doesn’t matter; if your tone reflects warmth and kindness, your friend will pick up on that. They’ll understand that you’re there to care for them and that you’re doing your best.</p>

<strong>Something else to consider is making an offer to help practically. Don’t assume you know what your friend needs. Instead, ask how you can help.</strong>

<p>If your friend is struggling to express what they need, you could suggest something practical that you could do for them.</p>

<p>You could do some chores around the house for them, go food shopping for them, clean up for them, or do something else that you know they need. You could also just offer to walk with them to get them outside, which might lift their spirits.</p>

<p>Remember that sometimes, it’s not just what you say or how you say it; it’s the things you do that show you care.</p>

<p>Maybe, like me, you’re not the best with words, but your actions can show that you care about your friend and want to help them.</p>

<strong>The final piece of advice that I have for you is to be patient. You might be ready to talk and offer sage and sound advice, but maybe your friend isn’t ready to hear it.</strong>

<p>If that happens, just remind your friend or reassure them that you’ll listen when they are ready to talk, and you don’t need to offer any advice at all if they just want an ear.</p>

<p>Don’t take it personally if your friend says or does things that upset or hurt you. They might cancel plans with you or become irritable. Remember to be patient and understanding because this is how you ultimately offer the support they need.</p>

<p>And if they cancel on you, know that it doesn’t reflect badly on you. It’s a reflection of where they are at the current time.</p>
<br/>
<strong style="font-size: 20px">So remember:</strong>
<p>Be quick to listen, speak consolingly, offer practical help, and be patient.</p>

<p>This winning combination offers the most benefit to you and your friend.</p>

<p>Well done for wanting to help your friend out; dealing with mental health challenges isn’t easy, but having someone to talk to is so important.</p>

        title: "4 Fears That Create People-Pleasers and How to Ease Them",
        image: "./img/people_pleasure.jpg",
        content: `<strong>“It feels good to be accepted, loved, and approved of by others, but often the membership fee to belong to that club is far too high of a price to pay.” ~Dennis Merritt Jones</strong>

<br/><br/><p>Like a lot of people, I grew up putting others’ needs and wants first. I learned early that doing things for other people and accommodating their wishes gained me attention and approval. It was only in those moments that I felt good enough and deserving of love.</p>

<p>As a child, I liked nothing more than feeling indispensable and being told I was a good and nice girl. This praise was incredibly important to me, as was making others happy. My own happiness did not come into the equation; I was happy because they were happy. I felt loved, safe, and appreciated, in the short term at least.</p>

<p>As I got older, my people-pleasing went into overdrive. I continually tried to gain people’s approval, make them happy, and help them whenever needed.</p>

<p>I hated to see loved ones hurt or upset and felt it was my responsibility to come to their rescue and ease their problems and pain. Before long, I became so hyper-aware of others’ feelings that I lost sight of where I ended and where other people began.</p>

<p>For many years, I didn’t question why I felt I didn’t have the right to say no to people’s demands. I just assumed this was how my relationships were meant to be. By the time I was in my late teens, however, I often felt lost, drained, and empty.</p>

<p>After a terrifying anxiety attack, I realized I’d been unhappy for years. Trying to please everyone had made me miserable and ill, and my relationships felt draining and one-sided.</p>

<p>I took a long, hard look at myself and realized I’d become a people-pleaser not simply because I wanted to be a nice person or help others, but due to a specific emotion, an emotion I’d felt since early childhood: fear.</p>

<p>I realized I’d given control over my life to other people out of fear. I’d let an emotion steal my life and well-being.</p>

<p>When I examined my past behavior, it was obvious I’d been compelled to people-please due to a fear of certain situations stemming from my childhood. I believe these specific fears are the reason why many of us become people-pleasers.</p>

<br/><strong style="font-size: 20px">Fear of Rejection and Abandonment</strong>
<p>Inside every people-pleaser is a little child who never felt worthy of love and was afraid of being rejected and abandoned by his or her loved ones. Being good and nice and striving for approval is a way to try to suppress the fear.</p>

<p>Children know instinctively that their survival depends on other people. As a child, I felt I had to be good all the time—one misdemeanor would be enough to make my loved ones reject me.</p>

<p>That’s not to say my family didn’t love me; they absolutely did. But they were often emotionally distant, worried, stressed out, and very busy with other things. My strategy was to do my best to please them so I wouldn’t feel even more rejected than I already did.</p>

<p>Many of us take this fear into our adult relationships too. People-pleasers usually believe they cannot disagree, not do as their loved ones want, or displease them in some way because their family or partner will stop loving them and leave. They don’t feel emotionally secure in their relationships.</p>

<p>Yet how realistic is this belief? Would our loved ones really reject and abandon us if we displeased them? Is our position in their lives so uncertain and fragile that they would do this?</p>

<p>People-pleasers tend to overestimate other people’s imagined negative reactions to what they do or say. They work hard to gain and keep love and friendship, but assume those ties are easily broken.</p>

<p>Realistically, it’s highly unlikely your loved ones will reject you if you don’t do what they want. They might be disappointed or upset, but ultimately they’ll be able to cope with their expectations not being met. Regardless of their response, you aren’t responsible for their emotions or actions.</p>

<p>When we know this, we can feel more secure about saying no to others. And that in turn helps them to respect our boundaries.</p>

<br/><strong style="font-size: 20px">Fear of Conflict and Anger</strong>
<p>People-pleasers try to avoid conflict and others’ anger at all costs and will do anything to defuse a confrontation or argument. This usually means backing down or not disagreeing, even if the other person is in the wrong. It means saying yes when we really want to say no.</p>

<p>When you fear upsetting someone and causing an argument, you don’t speak up about what’s bothering or hurting you, and you don’t reveal your true feelings. You do all you can to keep the peace, believing mistakenly that conflict of any kind is bad for relationships.</p>

<p>The truth is, our peacekeeping behavior builds a barrier to intimacy. It stops our relationships from growing and maturing. As a child I feared doing something wrong and being told off and punished, and as I got older I often felt lonely in many of my relationships. I also found trying to keep the peace exhausting.</p>

<p>The harmony I worked so hard to maintain was nothing more than a false harmony; there was often an undercurrent of anxiety and frustration.</p>

<p>Healthy relationships aren’t without disagreements because conflict and problems are inevitable in life. But the difference is that good, balanced relationships are able to handle conflict and problems constructively and use them as a way to deepen learning and understanding.</p>

<p>As a people-pleaser, I wanted to find instant solutions to problems in order to minimize any potential conflict, regain harmony, and soothe any negative feelings. I rarely took my time to find an effective solution, and as a result, the problems were never fully resolved.</p>

<p>I was also afraid of my own anger and repressed it or directed it at myself, and this no doubt contributed to my anxiety disorder. I mistakenly believed nice people didn’t get angry, not realizing that we cannot change our behavior for the better or improve our well-being unless we feel and recognize all our emotions.</p>

<br/><strong style="font-size: 20px">Fear of Criticism and Being Disliked</strong>
<p>No one likes to be criticized or disliked, especially a people-pleaser. We hold in high regard other people’s good opinions of us. We crave approval and think that accommodating everyone else will somehow protect us, but that’s rarely the case.</p>

<p>I used to feel a sense of betrayal whenever someone criticized me. Didn’t they know how hard I tried to please them? How hard I tried to be good and nice all the time? Their criticism was like an arrow in the heart.</p>

<p>When we fear others’ lack of approval and acceptance, we rarely show them who we really are and often live a life that does not feel authentic. We hide ourselves behind a mask of niceness and find it near impossible to separate our self-worth from our actions.</p>

<p>Fearing others’ bad opinions of you makes you feel you cannot show you are fallible and flawed—basically, a normal human being.</p>

<p>People-pleasers judge themselves very harshly and often set themselves unrealistic expectations. They feel they need to be perfect in order to be accepted or loved. They feel they cannot make mistakes or risk upsetting or disappointing people.</p>

<p>If you don’t voice your opinions or needs, people will assume you’re happy to go along with what they want. They’ll also assume you’ll accept disrespectful behavior. Like many people-pleasers, I became an easy target for others’ dissatisfaction and nastiness.</p>

<p>When we hand so much control over to other people, their criticism can be devastating, but this is only because we vastly overestimate the importance of what they think.</p>

<p>In time, I realized that someone’s opinion of me is none of my business, and it’s impossible to control their thoughts about me, no matter what I do. It seemed crazy to let their opinions dictate how I lived my life because the only person I needed to seek approval from was myself.</p>

<br/><strong style="font-size: 20px">Fear of Losing Control and Not Being Needed</strong>
<p>People-pleasers need to be needed. It’s their automatic response to help others and try to make others happy, and they very often take other people’s actions, behavior, and emotions personally, believing they’re responsible for making others feel better.</p>

<p>I grew up in an environment that was often anxious. Many of my loved ones did not handle their anxiety very well, due to their own upbringing. I became a confidante at a young age, before I had the maturity to handle certain problems or others’ anxiety. It was simply too burdensome for my young shoulders, but it didn’t stop me from trying to make things better.</p>

<p>Because my sense of self was closely tied to how other people felt, I couldn’t bear to see loved ones hurting, and so I tried my hardest to ease any upset. Each time I succeeded, I felt needed and in control, but when I failed, I felt like I had let everyone down.</p>

<p>I would become anxious if I couldn’t soothe or help someone else. I readily soaked up their negative emotions because I’d become so attuned to their feelings that I felt responsible for them.</p>

<p>This response often left me drained and overwhelmed. I realized I’d become so accustomed to being the caretaker that I feared people wouldn’t need me anymore if I didn’t step in to help them. I confused my self-worth with being helpful, but over time, I learned that I could be worthy without being in service to someone else.</p>

<br/><strong style="font-size: 20px">Conclusion</strong>
<p>It’s taken years for me to understand my people-pleasing behavior and untangle the roots of my fears. I’m still learning to love myself, recognize my worth, and set healthy boundaries. I want others to love me for who I truly am, not who they want me to be.</p>

<p>It’s okay to love people while not putting their needs above my own. I’m learning to say no without guilt, find my voice, and speak my truth.</p>

<p>Every time I take a small stand for myself, I feel a sense of pride and hope I never thought possible. The world may be a chaotic place, but I’m discovering there is power in learning to stand tall and be true to myself.</p>

        title: "5 Pillars of Mindful Awareness That Transformed My Life",
        image: "./img/mindfullness.jpg",
        content: `<strong>“When things change inside of you, things change around you.” ~Unknown</strong><br/> <br/>

<p>When I was twenty-three, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. It was not until two years later, when I stopped taking medication, that I discovered I had a mental health disorder linked to my menstrual cycles.</p>

<p>Meditating daily has been foundational for my well-being. It helps me manage the physical expressions of anxiety and bad moods. It allows me to be more accepting of myself and grateful for the many positives in my life.</p>

<p>But it is the awareness journey that mindfulness has paved over these last seven years that has reached so many different corners of my life.</p>

<p>The awareness I developed from regular practice seeps into my life as a positive multiplier, pushing further progress in emotional regulation and health. It inspired me to start journaling daily. It encouraged me to face myself, my fears, and my choices.</p>

<p>With awareness comes meaningful change. I completely pivoted my life, walking away from my career in the investment industry to prioritize things that I discovered I valued the most.</p>

<p>This is just one transformation that has come from developing different types of awareness. Together, these form the pillars of a healthy, fruitful relationship with myself and the world around me.</p>

<p>Everybody’s awareness journey will be different; you cannot know where yours will lead. But in case it helps with your reflection and journey, I am sharing the questions I faced on mine.</p>
<br/>
<strong style="font-size: 20px">Awareness of Emotions: Taking Back Control from the Unconscious</strong>
<p>Mindfulness practice revealed how much my emotions had a hold over me. I previously saw no separation between myself and my emotions. I let them convince me of things that weren’t true and lead my decisions.</p>

<p>But now my relationship with my emotions has transformed from one of “I am this feeling” to “this feeling is happening to me.”</p>

<p>Awareness of feelings reveals some key things. Firstly, emotions are temporary. Secondly, many emotions come from an instinctive, animalistic part of us, cropping up to protect us. This means they can often impact our perceptions and rationality.</p>

<p>Emotions are there to serve us, as is our stress reaction. But we must recognize these bodily reactions for what they are—processes that need completing. Stress and negative emotions are often linked to significant health problems, but the power to minimize their impacts is within our reach.</p>

<p>With awareness, I recognize my changing views, desires to act, and needs to service all the different parts of myself. The latter includes the person I am at my core, the part that houses my rationality and values. Quick, emotional reactions do not tend to represent this part.</p>

<p>At first, it was difficult to accept all the parts of myself that awareness uncovers. But it paved the way for enhanced emotional regulation and management. I now know how to take the messages my emotions are trying to send me, feel them, settle them, and act in a way that represents all parts.</p>

<p>When we do this, we change unconscious reactions, led by emotions, to conscious responses. It’s okay if we still have racing thoughts; it’s how we act that matters. We take back ownership of our lives from our emotions by making constructive choices.</p>

    <li>Can I name my emotions and the feelings toward the events or people involved?</li>
    <li>How did the desire to react manifest?</li>
    <li>Why might I feel this way, and what are my needs?</li>
    <li>Does this point to any unhealed pain, fears, or insecurities?</li>
    <li>How did my feelings and perceptions change, and what contributed to this?</li>
    <li>Which thoughts are supported by evidence, and where do I need more clarity?</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<strong style="font-size: 20px">Awareness of Capacity: Getting the Best Out of Myself</strong>
<p>When we are not feeling like our best selves, we naturally blame our circumstances or problems. We often completely overlook how much our inner space influences our feelings, our functioning, and what we get out of the world.</p>

<p>By paying attention, I discovered how so much inside of me is always changing. My motivation, my energy, and my physiology change across the month. Patterns started to appear—times when my self-doubt and limiting beliefs were louder, or when my cognitive or physical strength were weaker.</p>

<p>Some things cycle naturally. Some are heavily influenced by “too much of this” or “too little of that.” I see the links between physical factors, mindset, and progress.</p>

<p>You can consume all the motivational quotes about success and personal growth out there, but if you do not prioritize your health, you are setting out on the wrong foot.</p>

<p>Intuitively, we function best when we look after ourselves. We are most confident when we can recognize our self-doubt for what it is.</p>

<p>With awareness, I can identify and meet my needs. Whether that be self-compassion practice when my self-doubt is loud or fueling my brain when it feels slow. I also match activities to when they best suit my capacity, working with myself instead of beating myself up.</p>

<strong>Reflection questions for awareness of capacity:</strong>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px">
    <li>When do I feel most energized, motivated, creative, focused, and confident?</li>
    <li>What are my motivation and energy killers and boosters?</li>
    <li>When do I find it easiest to make decisions?</li>
    <li>Which activities work best for when my brain feels slow, my body feels weak, or my social capacity is low?</li>
    <li>Here are some things to consider: sleep, nutrition, movement, connection with nature, time with loved ones, stress management, and downtime.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<strong style="font-size: 20px">Awareness in Relationships: Finding Peace and Improving Connections</strong>
<p>Reflecting on some past relationships, it often feels like I wasn’t a part of them at all. Driven by unconscious reactions and people-pleasing, they hardly felt authentic, and this really limited their richness.</p>

<p>We can learn a lot about ourselves from our approach to relationships. Our deepest traumas manifest in our triggers. Our actions are mostly driven by our fears and insecurities, often underpinned by the need for validation and fear of rejection.</p>

<p>Once we deal with these at the root and take back our life from our emotions, we enter a new space. Challenges with other people stop becoming reasons to walk away or make an enemy, but instead become opportunities to build something stronger. Or at least they give us a chance to act more authentically.</p>

<p>Awareness of my own changing feelings, needs, and typical behaviors provides a level of empathy that is nothing less than superhuman.</p>

<p>Known as a main ingredient for successful relationships, empathy is the understanding and patience we need to lovingly consider things from another’s perspective. Most of the time, everybody is trying their best to navigate the world and their relationships, acting in ways they’ve learned from their experiences rather than out of selfishness.</p>

<p>Boundaries are still key when there is a misalignment of standards and values. But empathizing is useful for finding acceptance where needed. Where alignment exists, empathy is the tool that helps relationships grow and enriches connections.</p>
<br/>
<strong>Reflecting on relationships:</strong>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px">
    <li>What are my values, wants, needs, and expectations, and do I know where they come from?</li>
    <li>Do I approach things authentically, or do I have ulterior motives?</li>
    <li>What challenges do I often face in relationships, and what is my approach usually?</li>
    <li>What assumptions do I make about how others should behave?</li>
    <li>Do these answers reveal areas of required self-work?</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<strong style="font-size: 20px">Awareness for Connection: Feeling Present in the World</strong>
<p>Becoming aware and being present are one and the same thing. When we practice mindfulness, we pay attention to the present moment. Mindfulness isn’t just about cultivating self-awareness; we also train our brains to be aware of everything around us.</p>

<p>Before my awareness journey, I lived in my head. Mulling over events, worrying about things that could be, and constructing scenarios, I took attention away from everything around me.</p>

<p>With mindfulness practice, you transform your relationship with your thoughts, just like you do with your emotions. You realize thoughts are just thoughts, and you don’t have to get so wrapped up in them. They become much easier to let go, and with time, your mind can become quieter.</p>

<p>When we practice being present, we train ourselves to notice the little things around us. I hear the birds in the morning. I feel the wind against my skin. I see the pattern on the tie of the person sitting opposite me.</p>

<p>Awareness of the world is connection to the world. And it is connection that ultimately helps us feel mentally well. This kind of awareness gives us the sense of grounding we need to get out of our heads and feel alive in the world.</p>
<br/>
<strong>Maximizing external awareness:</strong>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px">
    <li>Practice awareness of sounds, sensations, and smells during meditation.</li>
    <li>Take mindful moments during the day for a few deep breaths.</li>
    <li>Get out into nature.</li>
    <li>Make activities mindful by engaging the senses. What can I see, hear, smell, and feel?</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<strong style="font-size: 20px">Awareness of Living: Leading an Intentional Life</strong>
<p>Previously, I worked toward other people’s ideas of success and things I thought I “should” have or do. And I know I’m not alone.</p>

<p>Again, fear underpins a lot of our motives, as we dread being judged or not accepted. We often prioritize conforming over doing things that are meaningful to us personally. We lack self-compassion, compare ourselves to others, and find it hard to say no.</p>

<p>Intentional living starts with really understanding why we want the things we want and do or don’t do certain things. Then we can take ownership of our life direction and make choices in line with our values, not what we feel is expected of us.</p>

<p>With awareness, we can trust that any consequences of living authentically are insignificant compared to the benefits.</p>

<p>It is totally possible to go through life passively, going with whatever is presented to us. It is easy to pick up short-term pleasures and continually get sucked into the moment. But if we do this, we will always be haunted by a sense of unfulfillment.</p>

<p>Awareness shines a light on passive living and encourages us to enjoy the present while making decisions for the long term.</p>
<br/>
<strong>Reflecting on your approach to life:</strong>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px">
    <li>Why do I want the things I want?</li>
    <li>Am I measuring progress by comparing myself to others?</li>
    <li>What is meaningful to me, and what are my values?</li>
    <li>Which parts of my life lack alignment to these?</li>
    <li>What do I think is expected of me, and how can I deal with these pressures?</li>
    <li>When did I last make active decisions or changes for alignment in my life?</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<strong style="font-size: 20px">Your Awareness Journey</strong>
<p>Ultimately, this is a journey that will never end. We are constantly changing, and life around us is forever moving, so there will always be a need for reflection. You might become great at recognizing your feelings and staying present, but it will still be something you should practice to maintain.</p>

<p>When we accept that, like our mental well-being, awareness is not a destination, we can enjoy continually managing life rather than redundantly wishing for things to be different.</p>

<p>With awareness, life becomes an art. Regardless of what it throws at you, you have a powerful tool to navigate and make something out of it.</p>

        image: "./img/beautiful_life.jpg",
        content: `  <strong>“If you don’t give your mind and body a break, you’ll break. Stop pushing yourself through pain and exhaustion and take care of your needs.” ~Lori Deschene</strong>
  
  <br/><br/><p>For forty-five minutes, I lay on my yoga mat in child’s pose, unable to move. The exhaustion in my body felt like a thousand kilos, and the ache of failure pricked my eyes with tears.</p>
  <br/>
  <strong style="font-size: 20px">The Realization of Burnout:</strong>
  <p>Despite all my early morning runs, after-work bootcamps, and restricted meals, my body did not look like the bikini models I saw on Instagram. Despite all my energy, efforts, and attention, my romantic relationship had fallen apart. No matter what I did or how hard I tried, he didn’t love me anymore, and I couldn’t understand what I had done wrong.</p>

  <p>Despite my long working hours and high levels of stress, my boss didn’t recognize me, and I had to face the fact that I just wasn’t the talented designer I was trying so hard to be.</p>
  <br/>
  <p>As I wallowed in my failure and the heartbreak of ‘not enough,’ I felt my body pleading with me.</p>

  <p>“Why don’t you love me?” she asked. “Why do you push me so hard? Why is it NEVER enough?”</p>

  <p>I was taken aback, as it was the first time I heard this voice, and it was full of the pain of rejection.</p>
  <br/>
  <strong style="font-size: 20px">The Shift in Perspective:</strong>
  <p>In that moment, I realized that everything I had been pushing for had been sending the message that I was ultimately unacceptable as I was. I needed to change or be different in order to be loved, valued, and successful.</p>

  <p>The harder I tried to be perfect, to achieve, to prove my worth, the more exhausted, broken, and small I felt. By desperately trying to win other people’s approval, I was actually rejecting and abandoning myself.</p>

  <p>This realization flooded me with grief. What had I done to myself???</p>

  <p>Since this was clearly not working, I made a decision that changed my life.</p>

  <p>“Okay,” I said to my body. “We’re going to do things differently.”</p>

  <p>“From now on, I’m going to listen to you,” I promised. “We are going to do this TOGETHER.”</p>

  <p>As soon as I made this commitment, I felt my body exhale with relief. She had been waiting for this moment my whole life.</p>
  <br/>
  <strong style="font-size: 20px">The Journey Through Burnout:</strong>
  <p>In the months that followed, I left my job, I left my friendships, and I left the home my ex and I had built together. I found refuge on my parents’ couch with severe burnout. After years of pushing, my body had finally collapsed.</p>

  <p>My body struggled to walk to the end of the street. Being in a store was so overly stimulating that I felt like I was going to pass out. I couldn’t sleep for months. I had severe stomach pains and terrible migraines, and I couldn’t think straight. My heart was broken. I felt like my life was over.</p>

  <p>It was physically excruciating. It was emotionally devastating. It was the biggest blessing.</p>

  <p>My body was giving me the chance to start again.</p>
  <br/>
  <strong style="font-size: 20px">The Importance of Rebuilding:</strong>
  <p>The thing about burnout is that you can never go back to how you were living before. That way was clearly not working: the lifestyle, the thought patterns, the identity, the environments—it was not serving you.</p>

  <p>Burnout burns it all to the ground and forces you to start over.</p>

  <p>My identity used to be a “hardworking, people-pleasing perfectionist addicted to external validation.” If I hadn’t done the inner work to let go of that pattern and completely rewire my identity, I would have ended up straight back in burnout just a few years later (which is, sadly, something that happens to others).</p>

  <p>Trust me, burnout is not something you want to repeat. I promised myself I would NEVER end up in that situation again.</p>
  <br/>
  <strong style="font-size: 20px">Healing and Self-Love:</strong>
  <p>During my healing journey, I focused on building a relationship with myself and my body. Not one where I commanded and pushed my body, but one where I regularly checked in with her, learned to listen to her, and respectfully honored her needs.</p>

  <p>Every morning, I sat on my meditation cushion and took time to go within.</p>

  <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px">
    <li>What was I feeling?</li>
    <li>How was I speaking to myself?</li>
    <li>Where was I judging myself?</li>
    <li>What did my body need from me that day?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>My burnout took two years, almost three, to recover from fully. To say I felt impatient to feel “normal” again is an understatement.</p>

  <p>Any time I felt frustration toward my body, I quickly shifted my attitude to compassion and gratitude, recognizing that my body had been through hell and was doing her best to recharge back to optimal health. My impatience was only adding more stress that, honestly, she didn’t need to deal with.</p>
  <br/>
  <strong style="font-size: 20px">A New Way of Living:</strong>
  <p>It was in this way that I learned to love myself, as I was, without all the labels of achievement. Burnout had stripped away everything I had worked so hard for—my career, my relationships, my physique, my home. I had to learn to truly love myself without the badge of productivity.</p>

  <p>Through this loving commitment, my body guided me on how to live a life that was right for me.</p>

  <p>I found I was a Human Design Projector, which is an intuitive guide who needs to manage their energy to stay happy and healthy in this hectic productive-obsessed world. I adjusted my schedule based on my energetic rhythms to include more rest and play in my day (which, admittedly, was not easy at first with my workaholic tendencies, but now I can’t imagine any other way).</p>

  <p>Creating more space allowed me to find my soul’s purpose in teaching others how to connect to their bodies, love themselves unconditionally, and create successful lives in a sustainable way. I created a business based on what I love to do, began coaching women, and held retreats all over the world—without the extreme hustle I had been used to.</p>
  <br/>
  <strong style="font-size: 20px">Conclusion:</strong>
  <p>All the pressure to shrink down was gone. Instead of counting calories and pushing my body to the extreme, I focused on nutrition and movement that felt good. I didn’t care if my cellulite was showing or what people thought of the outfits I chose. The space that this opened up in my mind after years of obsession was the most freeing thing ever.</p>

  <p>Learning to love my body changed my entire approach to life. It made me aware of my boundaries for the first time and helped me to create balanced relationships that felt truly fulfilling.</p>

  <p>I went from overworking in a job I hated and over-giving in terrible relationships to running a purpose-led business where I get paid to be myself and surrounding myself with truly supportive people.</p>

  <p>All because my body pulled the brakes on my old life and made me change direction. She showed me there was a more sustainable, more joyful, and more aligned way to make my dreams come true. And for that, I am eternally grateful.</p>

        image: "./img/lonely.jpg",
        content: `
        <p>Starting college is an exciting time filled with new experiences, but it can also be a lonely one. Many students face feelings of isolation, especially during the first few months of transitioning into university life. Being away from home, adjusting to a new environment, and trying to build new friendships can often lead to loneliness. However, it’s important to remember that loneliness is a common experience for many, and there are effective ways to manage and overcome it.
        </p> 
        <br/> 
        <strong style="font-size: 20px">
        Why Do Students Feel Lonely?
        </strong> 
        <p>Several factors contribute to the feeling of loneliness among university students. Here are some common reasons:</p> <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px"> <li><strong>Homesickness:</strong> Being away from family, friends, and familiar surroundings can trigger feelings of loneliness, particularly in the first year when everything feels new and unfamiliar.
        </li> <li><strong>Social Pressures:</strong> Adjusting to university life and trying to find your social group can be overwhelming. If you don't immediately find a group to connect with, it can leave you feeling excluded.</li> <li><strong>Academic Stress:</strong> University work can be demanding, and spending long hours studying or working on assignments may isolate you from social activities.</li> <li><strong>Social Media Illusion:</strong> Seeing others on social media posting about fun events and friendships can give you the impression that everyone else is having a great time, which may heighten feelings of loneliness, even if you’re not actually missing out.</li>
        </ul> <br/> <strong style="font-size: 20px">Symptoms of Loneliness</strong> <p>Loneliness manifests differently in everyone. If you’re feeling isolated, you may notice some of the following signs:</p> <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px"> <li>Persistent feelings of sadness or anxiety</li> <li>Difficulty sleeping or eating regularly</li> <li>Loss of interest in social activities or interacting with others</li> <li>Spending more time alone than you would like</li> <li>Relying heavily on social media for interaction and connection</li> </ul> <br/> <strong style="font-size: 20px">How to Cope with Loneliness</strong> <p>Although loneliness can feel overwhelming, it's not something you have to face alone. There are several steps you can take to reduce feelings of isolation and build meaningful connections with others:</p> <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px"> <li><strong>Join Campus Clubs or Activities:</strong> Universities offer a variety of student groups, clubs, and societies. Joining one that interests you is a fantastic way to meet like-minded people and develop friendships based on shared interests.</li> <li><strong>Attend Social Events:</strong> Universities frequently organize events to help students connect and make new friends. Even if you don’t know anyone, attending these events can introduce you to potential friends and help you feel more integrated into campus life.</li> <li><strong>Reach Out to Classmates:</strong> Taking the initiative to start a conversation with classmates, dorm mates, or people you see regularly can open the door to new friendships.</li> <li><strong>Seek Professional Support:</strong> If feelings of loneliness persist, consider talking to a campus counselor. They can provide emotional support, practical advice, and connect you with resources to help you feel more at ease.</li> </ul> <br/> <strong style="font-size: 20px">Conclusion</strong> <p>Loneliness is a common but temporary experience that many university students face. By actively engaging in social activities, reaching out to others, and exploring new opportunities, you can combat feelings of isolation and build strong, meaningful relationships within your university community.</p>

        content: `
        <p>Social media has become deeply woven into the fabric of university life. Platforms like Instagram and Snapchat are essential for staying connected, sharing experiences, and keeping up with the latest trends. However, despite its many benefits, constant interaction with social media can take a toll on your mental well-being, contributing to issues like anxiety, depression, and diminished self-esteem.</p> <br/> <strong style="font-size: 20px">How Social Media Affects Mental Health</strong> <p>Although social media offers valuable opportunities to connect and stay informed, it also comes with some negative consequences. Here's how it can impact your mental health:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px"> <li><strong>Comparison Culture:</strong> Social media often presents a highlight reel of people’s lives, showing only the happiest and most exciting moments — vacations, parties, and achievements. Constantly comparing yourself to these curated images can make you feel like you’re falling behind, lowering your self-esteem and fostering feelings of inadequacy.</li> <li><strong>Fear of Missing Out (FOMO):</strong> Seeing friends at events, traveling, or hanging out without you can trigger feelings of isolation and exclusion, exacerbating anxiety and a fear of missing out on social opportunities.</li> <li><strong>Sleep Disruption:</strong> Spending too much time on social media, especially before bed, can disrupt your sleep patterns. Sleep deprivation, in turn, can worsen anxiety, depression, and stress.</li> <li><strong>Cyberbullying and Negative Comments:</strong> Social media also opens the door to cyberbullying or hurtful comments, which can lead to emotional distress, anxiety, and even depression.</li> </ul> <br/> <strong style="font-size: 20px">Recognizing the Signs of Social Media Burnout</strong> <p>If you spend too much time on social media, it might start to affect your mental health. Here are some warning signs that indicate you might need to take a break:</p> <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px"> <li>Feeling anxious or restless when you're away from your phone or unable to check social media.</li> <li>Obsessively checking for updates, likes, or messages.</li> <li>Feeling inadequate or experiencing low self-esteem as you compare yourself to others online.</li> <li>Experiencing difficulty sleeping due to late-night social media scrolling.</li> <li>Stress or anxiety related to missing out on events, trends, or social gatherings you see online.</li> </ul> 
        <br/> <strong style="font-size: 20px">How to Create Healthy Social Media Habits</strong> <p>To protect your mental health while still enjoying the benefits of social media, it’s crucial to develop healthy habits. Here are some practical strategies for managing your social media usage:</p> <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px"> <li><strong>Set Time Limits:</strong> Use app features that allow you to set daily time limits for social media use. This can prevent you from mindlessly scrolling for hours on end.</li> <li><strong>Unfollow Negative Accounts:</strong> If certain accounts make you feel worse about yourself, it’s okay to unfollow them. Surround yourself with content that uplifts and inspires you.</li> <li><strong>Take Regular Breaks:</strong> Periodically stepping away from social media gives you time to recharge and refocus on real-life activities that support your mental health.</li> <li><strong>Engage in Offline Activities:</strong> Participate in hobbies, hang out with friends in person, and spend time outdoors to maintain a healthy balance between your online and offline life.</li> </ul> <br/> <strong style="font-size: 20px">Conclusion</strong> <p>While social media can be a fantastic way to stay connected, it's important to recognize its impact on mental health. By setting boundaries, unfollowing negative accounts, and taking regular breaks, you can enjoy social media while safeguarding your well-being. Remember that taking care of your mental health should always come first.</p>
